## The mandatory recipe tostÃ³n intro

Last December I had one of those days that I got an annoying idea for a project and I can't get it out of my head until I do it. 

There is this recipe that I refined during the last years of some delicious chili oil - Originally started from the crude directions the friendly and talkative server at a Cantonese restaurant near PlaÃ§a Universitat gave me - And that we always keep stocked at home because it's delicious and elevates everything.

Hungry, 3 a.m. and only a sad bag of Mercadona instant noodle soup at home? How about a spoon of chilly oil on top of it and it's suddenly a Malatang-inspired delicacy? 

What was I saying? Ah yes, the annoying idea.  What if instead of making the usual liter or so I went and made an entire oil jar out of it for friends and family? I said to myself... I had yet not realized the logistics of manipulating 5 Liters of boiling oil.

So yeah, long story short, after an oily, hot and fragrant afternoon, I had around 30 jars of some delicious sauce to give away like I'm a friendly Evangelist giving bibles at the front of a high school.

## Ingredients

I'm going to write everything for a 1L of oil, this way the reader can apply their advanced math skills to multiply (or even divide, if we are in front of a genius!) to fit the amount of oil they want to get. Just be mindful that you have a pan or jar big enough for it, as it will be more than 1L by the end of the recipe.

**Dry ingredients** 
* 200g Chilli Flakes (see notes).
* 30g Sesame seeds.
* 1 teaspoon salt.
* 1 teaspoon sugar.

**Aromatic Oil**
* 1L neutral oil (see notes).

A selection of the following spices that you want. I'm going to put a ðŸ«‘ emoji by the ones I always use, the others I used on occasion and I know work well. I recommend doing the same, but everything is optional and can be adapted to your taste.

* 2 teaspoons Sichuan Peppercorn. ðŸ«‘
* 3 pieces Star anise.
* 3 pieces Cassia or Cinnamon.
* 4 Bay Leafs. ðŸ«‘
* 150g Scallion Greens. ðŸ«‘
* 50g Cilantro.
* 150g Thinly sliced onion. ðŸ«‘
* 100g Ginger, in slices. ðŸ«‘
* 2 or 3 Garlic pieces. ðŸ«‘

**Finishing**
* 50ml of Baijiu (for authenticity) or other flavorless alcohol like Vodka.


### Notes on the chili flakes
Pick the brand and cultivar that fits your spice tolerance level and personal taste. You don't need to prove anything to anyone.
We like it with some kick but without making it a masochist fantasy, but the brand that we use comes in smaller bags since I needed a big amount for this recipe (by this point I was starting to realize the magnitude of the tragedy) I had to go for a different one that ended up being very mild.

The small bag on the left is the brand I usually use, I can recommend it, good flavor. If you dislike spiciness and want something more on the toasty notes, the right one is a good option. The booth can be found in most import stores in the city. Maybe you need to look for them in the Korean section if you don't find them with the dried goods. 

### Notes on the oil
Ideally, you want to use here a high smoke point neutral flavor oil. A good quality refined Sunflower oil is a great option. It has no flavor and a 230ÂºC smoke point, which makes it perfect for high-temperature work. We are going to (Spoilers!) heat the oil to 180Âº during the recipe, so you need to avoid oils that burn at lower temperatures. This includes Butter, Lard, Coconut oil, unrefined oils like Corn, Peanut or Flaxseed, and also unrefined Sunflower oil (So be careful when buying sunflower seed oil that you get the right one!).

You could even use olive oil (in this economy?!) but do not use Extra Virgin Olive Oil (the first time I say this in my life) as it has a low smoke point, you want to use at least Virgin Olive Oil or just regular Olive Oil. Be mindful that olive oil has a flavor, so the final product will show it.

## Equipment
* A pot or wok that can fit all the oil you will use plus extra space for the spices.
* A heat-resistant jar or plate that can fit all the oil plus extra space for the chilis.
* A spatula or slotted spoon that can resist high temperature.
* A scale for measuring ingredients.
* A spoon!
* The only special equipment that I think will make your life easier is a kitchen thermometer.

About the kitchen thermometer. You can follow this recipe without it, but I think a kitchen thermometer is going to make your life simpler. Not only are you going to reduce your chances of burning the product, it's also going to help you achieve consistent and replicable results.

I currently use an [IKEA brand](https://www.ikea.com/es/es/p/fantast-termometro-temporizador-digital-negro-20103016/) one that has a probe and a magnet, this way I can just put the probe into what I'm measuring, stick the unit somewhere else, and use the alarm that will warn me once I'm getting close to the temperature I selected. It's very handy, but also on the expensive side. My first kitchen thermometer was one I got for less than 2â‚¬ in a chino and was a bit slow, but totally worked! Just try not to drop it in!

## The recipe
Finally, we got here! Do you have everything? Now for the easy part, cooking! (please ignore the state of my kitchen, these photos and post were never meant to be sent to anyone, so I did not bother to wipe every splash of the cooking process before the picture):

### The dry ingredients

### The aromatic oil

Measure all the Aromatic oil ingredients, dump the oil into your pot and clean the vegetables. You want to cut them in chonky pieces, a size where they have enough surface to release all the flavor but not too small so they will be a nightmare to remove (Leave that job to the peppercorns lol, if I had a [spice ball](https://137106273.cdn6.editmysite.com/uploads/1/3/7/1/137106273/s367055826969951762_p1116_i1_w2307.jpeg) I would use it, but I do not, so if you are on the same situation, get mentalized because the karate kid training is coming)

### Finishing touches

### Bottling
If you are a sane normal person, you can at this point just put the oil in a jar (if you m)
